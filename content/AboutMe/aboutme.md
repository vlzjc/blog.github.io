# ðŸ‘‹ Jaime Here!
Data Analyst

## who am I?

And yes, I did use my name as a greeting. */Hay.-meh/* :)

I would say that I am a data-savvy professional. Currently, Iâ€™m in charge of a small manufacturing business, where I lead a cross-functional team, overseeing logistics, sales, customer service, and ensure smooth operations. From streamlining processes to generating insightful reports.

With a background in Computer Science, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to data and technology, leading me to earn certifications in Google Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Six Sigma. Whether itâ€™s transcribing audio with precision, or creating dashboards in Excel,  I thrive on challenges that blend strategy, analysis, and teamwork.

Outside of work, you would maybe find me gaming. I like how gamers really use data-driven decisions. Whether itâ€™s analyzing stats to improve strategies, or which skills work best with what armor and weapons. Have you seen the player in Elden Ring one-shotting bosses? That there is hundreds of rows and columns containing stats, gears, consumables, etc. I love using my analytical mindset with a bit of fun or watch people use it. For me, itâ€™s all about discovering new ways to play and solve problems at the same time. aside from that... I'm prolly watching movies or a series or listening to an audio fiction
