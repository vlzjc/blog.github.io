# ðŸ‘‹ Jaime Here!
Data Analyst

And yes, I did use my name as a greeting. */Hay.-meh/* :)

I would say that I am a data-savvy professional. Currently, Iâ€™m in charge of a small manufacturing business, where I lead a cross-functional team, overseeing logistics, sales, customer service, and ensure smooth operations. From streamlining processes to generating insightful reports.

With a background in Computer Science, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to data and technology, leading me to earn certifications in Google Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and now furthering my knowlegde on Advanced Data Analytics. Whether itâ€™s exploration, collection, or creating dashboards,  I thrive on challenges that blend strategy, analysis, and creativity.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me gaming. I enjoy how gamers use data to make decisions, like analyzing stats or finding the best gear combinations. Ever seen someone one-shot bosses in Elden Ring? That takes hours of data and strategy. I like how people use an analytical mindset for fun, and sometimes I enjoy playing too.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or drop a messageâ€”I'd love to chat!
