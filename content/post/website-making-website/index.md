# Visuals and Website Making

I wasn’t sure if I should post this<br>some people say go for it, others say don’t. But here we are, because why not? 💪😅

Here’s the deal: the first website I built looked like a soap commercial. The second? Full-on obituary vibes. And the one after that? Straight out of the early 2010s. So this time, I tried to do it right. I spent hours scouring the internet, sifting through templates, and skimming articles… but honestly? I couldn’t tell you a single thing I read. Nothing stuck—just words on a screen—until I found Theme Stack by Jimmy. That’s when I created this site.
<br>Haha, just kidding—I actually spent somewhere between 19 and 24 hours over the past three days figuring this out. Why? Because I had no clue what Hugo or Go Language even were when I started. 🤦‍<br>About 65% of that time was just me restarting out of pure frustration because everything I made was riddled with errors. Oh, and I also have a job, that's different from what I want to be doing. Balancing work, trying not to rage quit again,  😅 and this site is barely done.

and here's the sitch, you probably know this by now and like I have mention before... People, like me, do not pay attention so much with short-form media at an all high and what not.
