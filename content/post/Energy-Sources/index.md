# Project Title: Data Visualization of Energy Sources from 1990 to 2020 using Power BI
## Project Purpose or Objective:

The objective of this project is to create an interactive and informative chart in Power BI that visualizes the yearly distribution of different energy sources (Biomass, Coal, Geothermal, Hydro, Natural Gas, Oil-based, Solar, and Wind) from 1990 to 2020. This visualization will enable stakeholders to better understand energy trends and transitions over the past three decades, highlighting changes in energy production and shifts toward renewable sources.

## Scope:
The project will:

* Import the provided dataset into Power BI.
* Create a chart or multiple charts that displays the annual data for each energy source (Biomass, Coal, Geothermal, Hydro, Natural Gas, Oil-based, Solar, Wind) from 1990 to 2020.
* Implement interactive features like filters, drill-down options, and tooltips for a deeper understanding of the data.
* Customize the chart to make it visually clear and intuitive for stakeholders, with color coding, labels, and a legend for better readability.

## Key Deliverables:
* A simple fully interactive Power BI dashboard displaying a chart that represent energy production by type over the years.
* A detailed report summarizing key trends, such as the rise of renewable energy sources (e.g., Solar and Wind) and the decline of fossil fuels (e.g., Coal and Oil).
* The Power BI file (.pbix) with the completed visualization, accessible for further analysis.
* A presentation of the chart findings, including insights on energy transitions.

## Resources:
* Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service
* The provided dataset (table)
* Power BI skills to create charts and customize visuals

## Stakeholders:
* Project Lead: Responsible for managing the project and ensuring timely delivery. (Yours Truly)
* Data Analysts: Assist in preparing and analyzing the data for meaningful insights. (the Author, Me, and I)
* End Users/Stakeholders: Decision-makers who will use the visualized data to understand energy trends and inform future strategies.
