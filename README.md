Projects Portfolio Website
Welcome to my Projects Portfolio! This repository is dedicated to the upcoming data analysis, maybe some machine learning, and other exciting projects that I am currently planning or working on. It serves as a roadmap of my professional journey and future goals in the tech space.

This site theme was made by [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It uses [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.
